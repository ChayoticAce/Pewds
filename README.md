# Pewds
program for pewds source code so you can see exactly what it does and how

1) I made this program in visual studio
2) then ran it
3) then took the debug .exe file it created
4) changed the .exe extension to .pif

thats it, thats how I made it

it works by creating programs when its opened, and I am releasing the code so people can see how I accomplished this and so you don't have
to worry that its doing anyting you dont want it to.
